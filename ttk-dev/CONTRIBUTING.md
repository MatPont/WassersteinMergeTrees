Thanks for contributing to TTK!

Please find below a few guidelines that we invite you to consider before making a pull request.

# 1. Authorship
  - Please enter in header files doxygen style information regarding authorship and, if applicable, related publications. See [core/base/topologicalSimplification/TopologicalSimplification.h](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk/blob/dev/core/base/topologicalSimplification/TopologicalSimplification.h) for a base layer example, [core/vtk/ttkTopologicalSimplification/ttkTopologicalSimplification.h](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk/blob/dev/core/vtk/ttkTopologicalSimplification/ttkTopologicalSimplification.h) for a vtk wrapper example and [paraview/TopologicalSimplification/TopologicalSimplification.xml](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk/blob/dev/paraview/TopologicalSimplification/TopologicalSimplification.xml) for a ParaView plugin example.

# 2. Code formatting
  - To make TTK's source code more homogeneous and readable, we use [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html). A style file is already available in TTK's source tree.
**Before creating a new pull request**, please make sure that you clang-formatted your local 
repository by entering the following command at the top of TTK's source tree: <code>
$ clang-format -i -style=file core/\*/\*/\*h core/\*/\*/\*cpp core/\*/\*/\*inl standalone/\*/\*/\*cpp</code>

  - To make your life even easier, we recommend that you setup a clang-format pre-commit hook, which will automatically run clang-format on any of your commits to your local repository.
For this, we recommend to use scripts such as [this one](https://github.com/barisione/clang-format-hooks/).


# 3. Continuous integration
  - TTK uses some basic continuous integration, which consists in testing for build success under Linux, Windows and MacOs (with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/)) upon each commit or pull request. **Your pull request will not be merged if it fails these tests**.
  - To make your life easier, we recommend that you sign up for this (free) service and that you connect your TTK github fork to it. This will run the build tests upon each of your commits to your local TTK repository.


# 4. Submitting code
  - If you plan to submit a **new module**, we invite you to read our [Guidelines for Developing a New TTK Module](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk/wiki/Guidelines-for-Developing-a-New-TTK-Module). 
  - Prepare your pull-request to the **dev** branch of [TTK](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk/tree/dev). **Before** submitting it, please make sure that your fork is in sync with the latest version of TTK's source tree (typically by entering a command like <code>git pull ttk-public dev</code>, where <code>ttk-public</code> is the name of your remote pointing to TTK's public source tree). Please make sure that your new code runs fine with TTK's performance mode turned on <code>TTK\_ENABLE\_KAMIKAZE=ON</code> (OFF by default on the **dev** branch).
  - Please submit a pull-request with an example to the **dev** branch of [ttk-data](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/tree/dev):
    - Provide a ParaView state file (*.pvsm) in the [<code>states/</code>](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/tree/dev/states) directory which runs your new module. This example will be used to both test and demo your module.
    - Provide new data sets if needed. For new data sets, please update the [README](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/blob/dev/README) file to include the corresponding references.
    - Make sure to remove all absolute paths from the state file example generated by ParaView (with a text editor). The state files are supposed to be run with ParaView from the root directory of [ttk-data](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data) (see [TTK's tutorial page](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/tutorials.html) for examples).
  - Please submit a pull-request to [topology-tool-kit.github.io](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/topology-tool-kit.github.io):
    - For this, generate a screenshot for the above ParaView state file example. Please include on the left of your screenshot a terminal with TTK's output (see examples on [TTK's gallery page](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/gallery.html)). Please use a dark color theme if possible.
    - Place that screenshot in [<code>img/gallery/</code>](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/topology-tool-kit.github.io/tree/master/img/gallery)
  - Prepare, if possible, a video tutorial, similar to those available on [TTK's tutorial page](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/tutorials.html). In this video, you should:
    - Open a terminal and load your state file demo to explain what it does and what it shows.
    - Re-open ParaView and re-create your state file pipeline **from scratch** (to show people how to put things together)

From our experience, video tutorials are **essential** to attract users towards new features. So if you want people to use your new module, you want to prepare a video tutorial. There are several excellent software packages for video editing (for instance [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/))
